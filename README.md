# About TrustInSoft CI

TrustInSoft CI is an online source code analyzer that continuously detects undefined behaviors in C and C++ programs (i.e. crash, arbitrary code execution, etc.).

It is more powerful than most current solutions because it can mathematically prove the absence of undefined behaviors. It also comes with a powerful user interface that helps developpers easily find the root cause of undefined behaviors.
